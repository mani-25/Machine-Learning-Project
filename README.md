Visualizing and Interpreting Machine Learning model for Living Patient Dataset

Tools used - R and Tableau

The use of machine learning algorithms has been embraced in several areas of biomedical research. These
algorithms are able to take into account high degree of interactions and create nonlinear response functions
to make predictions with high accuracy. This success comes at the cost of diminished interpretability. This
makes evaluation of machine learning methods’ trustworthiness difficult. In this work, several ad-hoc tools that
leverage the predictive power of machine learning methods are explored to provide insights into the method’s
decision-making rationale. For context, a generalized boosting machine is used to predict liver disease. The
interpretability and visualization have been explored from several vantage points and are presented with
insightful commentary.
